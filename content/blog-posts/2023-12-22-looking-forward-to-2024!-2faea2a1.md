<h2>
  
  
  Looking forward to next year!
</h2>

<p>This is my end-of-the year post as we all make our way into the New Year. </p>

<p>We've done quite a lot of things this year to help make oneAPI easier to use - a lot of the blog posts I've written as been towards an eye to educate.</p>

<p>We started off with some blog posts on how to use modern IDEs on Linux to write SYCL code and run them inside a container that we built, making a turn-key effort to build applications.</p>

<p>There was the introduction to '<a href="https://github.com/oneapi-community/awesome-oneapi" rel="noopener noreferrer">awesome oneAPI</a>' which showed a set of curated links to oneAPI projects showcasing all the capabilities. We have been updating it regularly, so check it out! We are definitely looking for more AI related projects - are you thinking of a project for next year? Need help? Let me know!</p>

<p>To complement the awesome oneAPI distribution, I have recently launched the <a href="https://oneapi-community.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">oneAPI Web Showcase</a> where we hope to discover upcoming projects that people are working on and showcasing them. There are also links on the website to help you start a project.</p>

<p>We now have community-focused documentation!!</p>

<p>I'll have another blog post up to show how you can help with the documentation by translating the documentation into different languages so that everybody can follow along in their native language. You can see the documentation at <a href="https://oneapi-community.github.io/documentation" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oneapi-community.github.io/documentation</a>. We hope to grow it into a true community hub for oneAPI and SYCL. Exciting! All of these are community projects in themselves. Want to help out? Reach out or just submit a PR!</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Goals for next year
</h2>

<p>I want to keep building on the work we've done in 2023. So many opportunities!! 2023 was all about meeting developers where they were. Now, it's also time to meet them where they are AND also communicate with them in their own language!!</p>

<p>The key to  adopting open platforms is to:</p>

<p>1) Have great documentation that's accessible in as many languages as possible.<br />
2) Plenty of code samples to look at how to do things.<br />
3) Great developer experience - be able to set up your environment and just go!<br />
4) Amazing community that interacts with each other, is active and works together.</p>

<p>These are all totally possible!! But, oneAPI is relatively new and still under one vendor. With the formation of the <a href="https://uxlfoundation.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">UXL Foundation</a>, we now have a neutral place for all vendors to congregate and work together. As a community, we should ask our hardware vendors to support level zero and be able to get all the advantages of hardware with a smooth hardware experience.</p>

<p>So where do we want to go from here - here are my personal goals/wish list for next year!</p>

<p>1) reproducible builds - we should be able to continuously build and test oneAPI software.<br />
2) More community assistance in documentation by helping translate the docs we have - as well as having more docs around tips and tricks.<br />
3) Adding more projects to Awesome oneAPI and having more PRs from the community to add their projects! :)</p>

<h2>
  
  
  Have a wonderful holiday season and a Happy New Year!
</h2>

<p>With that, I wish all of you a wonderful holiday season and looking forward to great things in the oneAPI ecosystem in 2024!!</p>
