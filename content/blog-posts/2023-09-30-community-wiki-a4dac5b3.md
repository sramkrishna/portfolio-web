<p>Hello!</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve started a community wiki that everyone from all walks of backgrounds could help contribute and share their knowledge with others. This would be a great place to do tricks and tips, more concise documentation to do specific things. </p>

<p>Contribution is through the usual methods of either submitting a pull request. Iâ€™m willing to entertain giving folks priv access since a single person is not scalable. Iâ€™m certainly willing to give to folks who represent other architectures like Arm, RocM, Nvidia, RISC-V and so on. The wiki should be a resource for everyone. The only thing I ask is to follow the PR  process regardless so that we can at least look over grammar and spelling for consistency sake.</p>

<p>The wiki also has documentation on how to build oneAPI and the DPC++ compiler from source. One of the things Iâ€™m really interested in, is being able to build documentation how to install the DPC++ compiler into system install areas - eg /usr/{lib,include} - installing it into a non-system target make distributing applications based on oneAPI much harder. We should eliminate that.</p>

<p>There are a LOT of interesting directions that we can take this. Iâ€™d love to start having weekly meetings on how we could work together on these builds and turn them into something independent of companies and make it a true community directive. Interested? Reach out! Hit the comments or find me on the HPC Social Slack! ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>We have plans for a community driven project showcase as well that Iâ€™m hoping will also help drive more projects using oneAPI but that isnâ€™t there yet. If youâ€™re curious feel free to check out <a href="https://oneapi-community.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://oneapi-community.github.io/</a> - Iâ€™m using Hugo. I wrote the CSS on it - Iâ€™m not a front-end web developer. But I couldnâ€™t find a Hugo theme that would show off projects. So like any good open source person, I wrote one - and scratched that itch! Once I have worked out all the kinks, I will release the Hugo theme. I also never used GitHub actions before - so that was a fun trip too. ðŸ˜€</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in helping out with the wiki - please check out: <a href="https://github.com/oneapi-community/community/wiki" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/oneapi-community/community/wiki</a>. PRs are most welcome.</p>

<p>I hope to start working on other community related projects like builds and packaging over the next 6 months or so. If youâ€™re interested in helping out with any of this - please let me know.</p>
