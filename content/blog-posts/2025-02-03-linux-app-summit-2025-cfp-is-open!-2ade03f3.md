<p>It's that time again, and we are in our 7th year doing this conference (if you include LAS GNOME).</p>

<p>This year, LAS will be held in Tirana, Albania and we are going all out this year to make it the best conference representing apps on Linux.</p>

<p>For those who don't know or have not heard of Linux App Summit, the idea is to have desktops work together to help enable application developers to build apps on the Linux platform. It's a parallel effort to the Flathub and Snapstore app stores.</p>

<p>LAS is positioned to promote third party developers, inform the ecosystems are the advances on the desktop, and for developers, designers, and contributors working on the desktops to meet each other and discuss how to move the platform forward as a community.</p>

<p>LAS's success depends on all of you. If you're passionate about making Linux as a viable alternative to proprietary platform then we need your help! Linux enables local control of your technology that you can adapt to your needs. Build local ecosystems enabling a local economy. A community driven platform will protect your privacy, safety, and security without bowing to shareholders or to politicians. This is the place to tell us about it!</p>

<p>So, I ask all of you to attend LAS, help drive our numbers up. Have a great idea that you won't to share with this ecosystem of developers? Implemented something on a phone, in an automobile, or something else? Have a great concept? Want to update all of us on what the next version of your app is going to do?</p>

<p>Through here, we can find out what is missing? What do we need to do move forward? What are the trends we should be looking at?</p>
