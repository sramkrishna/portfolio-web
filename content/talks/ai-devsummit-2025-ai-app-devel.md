## Talk Abstract

Demand for generative AI development is moving like a bullet train! Rapid
innovation can move lightning-fast and produce exciting projects. Now
is the time to embrace open development, refine best practices,
and collaborate on standards for all to benefit.  This session will
outline common pain points involved in building LLM-based generative AI
applications, especially those using RAG techniques, and connect them
to open solutions. We will share reference architectures to help shorten
developers’ paths to releasing performant AI applications to meet the
needs of stakeholders and users. Finally, we’ll share community efforts,
such as the Linux Foundation’s Open Platform for Enterprise AI project,
to advance this critical work.  Join us to explore ways to discover the
untapped potential in generative AI development workflows.

### Topics Discussed

- AI App Development using (OPEA)[https://opea.dev]
- Co-presenter with Katherine Druckman

### Notes

Unfortunately, there is no video for this talk. This was an Intel hosted conference but after the layoffs the conference has been dropped from the website. As I am the original organizer, you can find information 
on the conference, agenda, and whatever video we did have (here)(http://portfolio.ramkrishna.me/projects/intel-ai-summit-2025/.
