## Project Overview

Linux App Summit is a pure community conference focused on encouraging
developing apps on Linux. It brings together software engineers,
designers, Linux distributions, and ecosystem maintainers to help
educate, influence, and drive apps to app stores like FlatHub and the
Snap Store. By building a robust ecosystem, we can build sustainable
open source models that reward developers for their work.

Linux App Summit is two days of talks in a hybrid format.


### Key Responsibilities

- Define the theme for each year
- Outreach to developers and speakers
- Fundraising and sponsorship 

### Impact

- The ecosystem has maturing and the two largest projects, GNOME and KDE are working closer together than they ever have.
- Cross pollination between various projects are becoming more apparent as relationships blossom amongst ecosystem members.
