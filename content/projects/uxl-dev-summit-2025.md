## Conference Overview

The UXL DevSummit is a conference brand I created and managed during my tenure at Intel Corporation. The event's format centers on community-driven content (80%), featuring developers and practitioners demonstrating their work with the oneAPI specification through live demos and technical talks, showcasing the ecosystem's viability and real-world applications.

I developed the event playbook and served as Master of Ceremonies for this half-day summit, providing the run of show and executive oversight while a contractor handled day-to-day execution. I managed the live online conference, lending my voice and presence to create an engaging experience for attendees.

**The event was held online on Sept 17, 2025.**

### Key Responsibilities

- Make sure the playbook was executed faithfully.
- Manage the online conference and introduce the speakers using Zoom.
- Create things like the feedback form.

### Impact

- We had 80 attendees total, 11 talks, and 13 speakers.
- We've had speakers from corporations to universities showing the full breadth of the developer community behind oneAPI.
