## Project Overview

Linux App Summit is a pure community conference focused on encouraging
developing apps on Linux. It brings together software engineers,
designers, Linux distributions, and ecosystem maintainers to help
educate, influence, and drive apps to app stores like FlatHub and the
Snap Store. By building a robust ecosystem, we can build sustainable
open source models that reward developers for their work.
