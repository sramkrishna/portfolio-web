## About Me

With over 25 years bridging enterprise technology and open source communities, I've dedicated my career to making open source more accessible, sustainable, and impactful.

For over 25 years, I've worked across the open source landscape—from desktop environments to the Linux Foundation to open hardware initiatives—pioneering developer relations and community management before those roles existed in corporate open source. As one of GNOME's longest-serving contributors (since 1997) and a Foundation Board member, I've built contributor communities, managed strategic partnerships, and shaped project direction through engagement, social media, and public relations. More recently, I've coordinated initiatives like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code to create pathways for new contributors.

At Intel for two decades, I've worked at the intersection of enterprise IT and open source, helping define how corporations meaningfully engage with and contribute to free software communities. I'm passionate about sustainable open source development models, which led me to champion the Linux Application Summit—a GNOME-KDE collaboration that tackles app distribution challenges and improves developer sustainability.

My work focuses on the foundational but often overlooked: accessible onboarding processes, inclusive community spaces, and creating environments where diverse contributors can thrive. Whether organizing conferences, mentoring newcomers, or architecting technical solutions, I'm driven by ensuring open source remains vibrant and welcoming for the next generation.
