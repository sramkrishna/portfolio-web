## About Me

With over 25 years bridging enterprise technology and open source communities, I've dedicated my career to making open source more accessible, sustainable, and impactful.

Since 1997, I've been one of the longest-serving contributors to the GNOME project, pioneering developer relations and community management before those roles existed in corporate open source. As a Foundation Board member and engagement lead, I've spent nearly three decades building the contributor community, managing strategic partnerships, and shaping the project's direction through social media and public relations. More recently, I've taken on coordinating GNOME's participation in Outreachy and Google Summer of Code, creating pathways for the next generation of contributors.

At Intel for two decades, I've worked at the intersection of enterprise IT and open source, helping define how corporations meaningfully engage with and contribute to free software communities. I'm passionate about sustainable open source development models, which led me to champion the Linux Application Summitâ€”a GNOME-KDE collaboration that tackles app distribution challenges and improves developer sustainability.

My work focuses on the foundational but often overlooked: accessible onboarding processes, inclusive community spaces, and creating environments where diverse contributors can thrive. Whether organizing conferences, mentoring newcomers, or architecting technical solutions, I'm driven by ensuring open source remains vibrant and welcoming for the next generation.
