## About Me

With over 25 years bridging enterprise technology and open source communities, I've dedicated my career to making open source more accessible, sustainable, and impactful.

As one of GNOME's longest-serving contributors (since 1997) and a former GNOME Foundation Board member, I pioneered developer relations and community management in the late 90s and early 2000s—before those roles existed in corporate contexts—building deep expertise in contributor community development, strategic partnerships, and project direction through engagement, social media, and public relations. This foundation has enabled me to work across the broader open source landscape, from the Linux App Ecosystem to corporate open source ecosystems supported by the Linux Foundation, CNCF, and the Open Compute Project, to open hardware initiatives. More recently, I've coordinated GNOME's participation in Outreachy and Google Summer of Code, creating pathways for new contributors.

At Intel for two decades, I've worked at the intersection of enterprise IT and open source, helping define how corporations meaningfully engage with and contribute to free software communities. I'm passionate about sustainable open source development models, which led me to champion the Linux Application Summit—a GNOME-KDE collaboration that tackles app distribution challenges and improves developer sustainability.

My work focuses on the foundational but often overlooked: accessible onboarding processes, inclusive community spaces, and creating environments where diverse contributors can thrive. With a decade of professional event management under my belt—particularly virtual and hybrid formats—I've earned a reputation for delivering conferences and gatherings that bring communities together effectively. Whether organizing technical summits, mentoring newcomers, or architecting solutions, I'm driven by ensuring open source remains vibrant and welcoming for the next generation.
