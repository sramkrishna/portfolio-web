## About Me

I'm Sriram Ramkrishna (Sri), a multi-disciplinary technologist bridging the worlds of open source community building, enterprise technology, and strategic leadership. With over 25 years of experience spanning technical architecture and people-centered collaboration, I've dedicated my career to fostering sustainable open source ecosystems.

Since 1997, I've been deeply involved with the GNOME project—one of the longest-serving contributors in the community. My work focuses on community engagement, developer outreach, and building pathways for the next generation of open source contributors through initiatives like Outreachy and Google Summer of Code. I've served on the GNOME Foundation Board of Directors and currently lead engagement efforts across social media, public relations, and strategic partnerships.

At Intel, I've spent two decades working at the intersection of enterprise IT and open source, helping shape how corporations engage with and contribute to free software communities. I'm passionate about creating sustainable models for open source development, championing initiatives like the Linux Application Summit—a collaborative effort between GNOME and KDE to improve app distribution and developer sustainability.

Beyond code and community management, I'm an advocate for developer documentation, accessible onboarding processes, and ensuring that open source remains a vibrant, inclusive space where diverse voices can thrive. Whether it's organizing conferences, mentoring new contributors, or architecting technical solutions, my driving force is building bridges between people, projects, and possibilities.
